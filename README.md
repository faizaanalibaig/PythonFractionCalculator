# PythonFractionCalculator

**A user-friendly Python class for working with fractions. Perform precise arithmetic operations on fractional values effortlessly, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and Division**



Description: Fraction Operations in Python

Aim of the Project:
The goal of this Python project is to create a custom datatype, represented by the Fraction class, capable of storing and performing arithmetic operations on fractional values. This project aims to provide a simple and intuitive way to work with fractions in Python.

Purpose of the Code:
The purpose of the code is to implement a basic fraction manipulation tool. The Fraction class allows users to instantiate fractions with specified numerators and denominators and perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Operations Supported by the Class:

Addition (__add__): Adds two fractions.
Subtraction (__sub__): Subtracts one fraction from another.
Multiplication (__mul__): Multiplies two fractions.
Division (__truediv__): Divides one fraction by another.
String Representation (__str__): Provides a string representation of the fraction.


Merits and Demerits:

Merits:

Offers a straightforward implementation for working with fractions in Python. 

Allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations on fractions seamlessly.

Demerits:

Limited to basic arithmetic operations; does not handle more complex mathematical operations.

Does not include error handling for cases such as performing operations on three or more fractions.


Use Cases:

Educational Purposes:

Suitable for educational environments to teach the concept of fractions using Python.
Provides a hands-on example of creating a custom class for specific data types.

Simple Calculations:

Useful for situations where basic fraction calculations are required in Python scripts or programs.
